## Description

**NEO Lux** was developed to provide an easy way to interact with Smart Contracts in the NEO blockchain using C#. 

A full node is not necessary, but you can have one running locally and connect to it using NEO Lux.

## Compatibility

Platform 		| Status
:---------------------- | :------------
.NET framework 		| Working
UWP 			| Working
Mono 			| Working
Xamarin / Mobile 	| Untested
Unity 			| Working


## Installation

    PM> Install-Package NeoLux

# Usage

Import the package:

```c#
using NeoLux;
```

For invoking a Smart Contract, e.g.:

```c#
	var privKey = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXprivatekeyhereXXXXXXXXXXX".HexToBytes();	 // can be any valid private key
	var myKeys = new KeyPair(privKey);
	var scriptHash = "de1a53be359e8be9f3d11627bcca40548a2d5bc1"; // the scriptHash of the smart contract you want to use	
	// for now, contracts must be in the format Main(string operation, object[] args)
	var result = NeoAPI.CallContract(NeoAPI.Net.Test, myKeys, scriptHash, "registerMailbox", new object[] { "ABCDE", "demo@phantasma.io" });
```

For transfering assets (NEO or GAS), e.g.:

```c#
	var privKey = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXprivatekeyhereXXXXXXXXXXX".HexToBytes();	 // can be any valid private key
	var myKeys = new KeyPair(privKey);
	// WARNING: For now use test net only, this code is experimental, you could lose real assets if using main net
	var result = NeoAPI.SendAsset(NeoAPI.Net.Test, "AanTL6pTTEdnphXpyPMgb7PSE8ifSWpcXU" /*destination address*/, "GAS", 3 /*amount to send */ , myKeys);
```

For getting the balance of an address:

```c#
	var balances = NeoAPI.GetBalance(NeoAPI.Net.Test, "AYpY8MKiJ9q5Fpt4EeQQmoYRHxdNHzwWHk");
	foreach (var entry in balances)
	{
		Console.WriteLine(entry.Key + " => " + entry.Value);
	}
```

# Console Demo

A console program is included to demonstrate common features:
+ Loading private keys
+ Obtaining wallet address from private key
+ Query balance from an address
+ Invoking a NEP5 Smart Contract (query symbol and total supply)

# Unity Support

NEOLux can be used together with Unity to make games that interact with the NEO blockchain.
A Unity demo showcasing loading a NEO wallet and querying the balance is included.

Use caution, as most NEOLux methods are blocking calls; in Unity the proper way to call them is using [Coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html).
```c#
    IEnumerator SyncBalance()
    {
        var balances = NeoAPI.GetBalance(NeoAPI.Net.Test, this.keys.address);
        this.balance = balances["NEO"];
    }
	
	// Then you call the method like this
	StartCoroutine(SyncBalance());
```

## Using with Unity

Don't drop the source code of NEOLux inside Unity, it won't work. Instead of the provided .UnityPackage file to install it (or use the included Demo project as a template for your project).

If you have weird compilation errors inside Unity, try the project "Api Compatibility Level" to .NET 4.6.
